    description: "The original Honda Ridgeline reinvented the pickup truck concept with its unibody construction and transverse-mounted engine—a significant departure from traditional body-on-frame trucks. Built on a modified version of the platform underpinning the Pilot SUV and Odyssey minivan, it featured four-door crew cab configuration with a 5-foot composite bed that included a lockable in-bed trunk and dual-action tailgate that could open down or to the side. Powered by a 3.5L V6 engine producing 247 HP paired with a five-speed automatic transmission and standard Variable Torque Management all-wheel drive (VTM-4), it offered more car-like handling than conventional trucks. The interior was significantly more refined than typical pickups of the era, with better materials and comfort features. While its maximum towing capacity of 5,000 pounds and payload around 1,500 pounds were lower than traditional pickups, the Ridgeline offered a compelling compromise between utility and comfort for buyers who occasionally needed truck capabilities but preferred SUV-like driving dynamics."

    description: "The current Ridgeline maintains the unibody construction concept but with more conventional pickup styling to address criticism that the first generation looked too much like an SUV with a bed. Still based on Honda's global light truck platform shared with the Pilot and Passport, it features improved proportions and more traditional truck design cues. Powered by a 3.5L V6 producing 280 HP paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission (originally six-speed until 2020), it offers front-wheel drive as standard with available torque-vectoring all-wheel drive. The innovative bed features continue with a larger in-bed trunk, dual-action tailgate, and available truck bed audio system that uses exciters to turn the bed walls into speakers. The interior is essentially shared with the Pilot, offering superior comfort and refinement compared to most midsize trucks. A significant refresh for 2021 introduced more rugged styling with a prominent grille and squared-off front end. While still not matching the towing or off-road capabilities of body-on-frame competitors, the second-generation Ridgeline has carved out a niche for buyers prioritizing on-road comfort, interior quality, and fuel efficiency in a pickup that handles everyday truck duties with ease."
